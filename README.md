# Unit 09 Node.js and ES6+ Homework: Developer Profile Generator
This is a command line application which prompts the user for a GitHub username and their favourite colour. It then generates a pdf profile page with its own styling containing some relevant information pulled from the user's profile.

## Approach
I started by breaking down the primary objective into individual parts. In order of desired completion I derived the following steps:

1. Ask the user for the GitHub user's username, and allow them to select a colour scheme defined in generateHTML.js
2. Collect the required information from the user's profile page using the GitHub API
3. Pass this information into the file system package to create an HTML page containing only the relevant information
4. Style the page based on the provided example
5. Using the HTML page generated by the file system, use another package to create a pdf

The package required to create the pdf from html was not specified, so I used the _html-pdf_ package. Aside from some styling issues this allowed me to create a close replica of the original HTML.

## Challenges
Long story short, most of the challenges with this project involved an unfamiliarity with the Node.JS environment.
